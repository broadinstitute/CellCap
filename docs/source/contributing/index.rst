Contributing
============

We aspire to make CellBender an easy-to-use, robust, and accurate software package
for the bioinformatics community. While we test and improve CellBender together
with our research collaborators, your feedback is invaluable to us and allows us
to steer CellBender in the direction that you find most useful in your research. If you
have an interesting idea or suggestion, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.

A github issue is often the right place to start a conversation about a new feature
or a bug fix.
From there, once we collectively agree on a sense of how to proceed, the repository
can be forked, changes made (using the ``dev`` branch), and a pull request (PR)
can be created. PRs are to target the ``dev`` branch.

If you encounter a bug, please file a detailed github
`issue <https://github.com/broadinstitute/CellBender/issues>`_
and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

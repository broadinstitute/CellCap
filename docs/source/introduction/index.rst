What is CellCap?
===================

CellCap is an open-source python package for analyzing single-cell perturbation data. The primary goal of CellCap is
modeling interpretable correspondence between cellular identity and perturbation response.

Is CellCap right for your data?
-----------------

Before you proceed to run CellCap, it's always important to ask if CellCap is right for you perturbation data.

Use CellCap to probe biological investigations
-------

CellCap should empower multiple biological investigations using single-cell perturbation data. There are a few suggested
questions user can apply CellCap to understand.

* Do perturbations behave similarly or differently:

* What transcriptional responses can a perturbation induce:

* Is a certain transcriptional response posed by a perturbation is cell-state specific:

* How large is this transcriptional response in this cell state:

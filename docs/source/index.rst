*CellCap* is a variational autoencoder to model correspondence between cellular
identity and perturbation response.

To determine if CellCap is right for your perturbation data, you can read
the :ref:`Introduction <introduction>`.


For a step-by-step tutorial on a simulation dataset and real single-cell perturbation, see the
:ref:`Tutorial <tutorial>` section.

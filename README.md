CellCap is a variational autoencoder for modeling correspondence between cellular identity and perturbation response
in single-cell data.

Quick installation
----------------------

CellCap can be installed via

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install cellcap

(and we recommend installing in its own ``conda`` environment to prevent
conflicts with other software).
